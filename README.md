We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information to or on the Website and the App. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at info@alroopa.com.


USAGE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION
The information collected from our users may be kept in our archives throughout the entire existance of the Website and the App. Your data may be used for the following reasons:

- Anonymous information (such as location, application, and interactions) might be shared with trusted partners in order to provide you with relevant advertising, offers or services.

- Your IP address or device ID might be identified by analytics platforms to help us assess the usage of our Website, the App and other services. The analytics platforms use the data only in aggregate form; no data is shared as to any individual user. Such information may be used by such companies or by us in, among other things, (1) facilitating the provision of new products, updates, enhancements and other services, (2) improving software, and other products, services and technologies, and (3) providing new products, services or technologies to you and customers of Company and/or Licensors.

Your consent will not be required for disclosure in cases (2), (3), and (4) above, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent we are required or permitted by law to do so.

You acknowledge and agree that we may copy, backup and store data (including personal information and sensitive data that you may upload or otherwise provide in connection with using our services) in the United States, Europe, or other countries or jurisdictions that may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which you are situated (including the European Union), but in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You consent to such collection, transfers and the processing of such data in such countries. You are solely responsible for determining whether any transfer of any personal information complies with applicable data protection or privacy laws before disclosing any such personal information or using our services.

We encrypt transmission of data on pages where you provide payment information. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from unauthorized (“hacked”) access or human error.


California Online Privacy Protection Act
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy- protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
